some questions when she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something and she still does n't so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students and after she walks out on that the principal decides enough is enough and forces her to go visit deana in the hospital

to it"}, {"sentence": "hoping to find a copy soon"}, {"sentence": "for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly"}, {"sentence": "in 1989 i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself"}, {"sentence": "it 's part of my family 's christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show

record that meant it was christmas"}, {"sentence": "a few years ago i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself"}, {"sentence": "if you ever get the chance it 's a lot of fungreat music heartwarming and cheesy"}, {"sentence": "it 's also interesting to see the 70 's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today"}, {"sentence": "i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like thisi guess normally performers do n't compromise their images by doing singalongs with the muppets but i'm glad he did"}, {"sentence": "even if you ca n't track down the video the soundtrack is worth it too"}, {"sentence": "it has some muppified traditional favorites but also some original denver tunes as well"}, {"sentence": "scott bartlett 's 'offon' is nine minutes of pure craziness"}, {"sentence": "it is a fullfrontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsyinducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avantegarde cinema"}, {"sentence": "there 's no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology"}, {"sentence": "in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology"}, {"sentence": "this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubrick 's '2001 a space odyssey ' and indeed bartlett 's opening sequence of images flashing colours before a closeup human eye recalls dave bowman 's journey through the stargate"}, {"sentence": "the visuals are richlycoloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video as though we 're sitting too close to a television screen br br there appears to be some confusion about the film 's release date"}, {"sentence": "imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year"}, {"sentence": "perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film 's completion and its first public screening"}, {"sentence": "either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music would n't have gone amiss either"}, {"sentence": "'offon' captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information"}, {"sentence": "i had a thought and please do n't laugh at this freethinking interpretation that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth 's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that could n't possibly make any coherent sense"}, {"sentence": "perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality"}, {"sentence": "imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources i 've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68"}, {"sentence": "does n't really matter except that it 's quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 released the same year"}, {"sentence": "pure abstraction is n't really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the supersaturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful"},

was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies were several stills for different movies from

public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4dvd set of treasures of american film archives released by the national film preservation foundation"}, {"sentence": "so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs"}, {"sentence": "after all these years i could finally see the film"}, {"sentence": "after viewing it it slightly was n't was i was expecting it to be but it was still an impressive film imho considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film including handtinting the film itself and using video equipment for some of the film 's scenes giving it a more distressed lores lookbr br do n't get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite groundbreaking for 1972 that 's why it 's still one of my favorite shortexperimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well"}, {"sentence": "when i read other commenti decided to watch this
